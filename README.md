Split into two different sections Platforming overworld and a Turn-based battle sequence. 

Platforming:
Platforming sections will be two different, simple “get to the goal” style sections with enemies scattered around. The player can traverse these stages via standard movement (walking, running, sliding, jumping) and empowered movement (air walking, extreme speed running, double jumping). The type of platforming stages with determine what the enemies do when you interact with them. Platforming sections will likely have you try and knock them out with gusts of wind(normally air punches), stay hidden to avoid being spotted, or trying to make it to a certain place in a certain amount of time. Platforming sections that involve enchanter enemies will likely be shorter and enchanter enemies will require you to dual them in an up to 3v3 turned based battle to the death. All bosses will be enchanters. 
 
Turn-based: 
The turn based combat is speed based: whoever is fastest goes first. There are 4 different options for combat: Doing a normal attack, using an Active Ability, Casting a spell, or defending. Normal attacks are just regular damaging strikes, Active Abilities vary based on the type of ID, Spells are cards made in a deck that has to be crafted in the overworld, and defending allows one to recover hp. Once all of one side is reduced to 0 the battle is over. When the player wins they pick up one of the enemies spells (if they have any) and is recovered to full health (the idea being that a player may risk going into an Enchanter duel in order to fully recover, if they lost some overworld health).
